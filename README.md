# Fire-ART
This is the repository for Firefighting asset recognition dataset (Fire-ART dataset)

Since the authors are enhancing the Fire-ART with more images and are preparing a journal paper regarding this, the full version will be available after the publication (Plan to finish and submit the manuscript in Mid 2025 and luckily we may expect to release the full dataset in Early 2026. Fingercrossing!).
